The objective of this research was to develop a linear regression model that could predict house prices based on the provided dataset's characteristics.
The dataset underwent pre-processing, which involved converting categorical features into numerical ones and standardizing the data. The model was then trained on the training set and assessed using RMSE on the validation set.
Correlation analysis and coefficient values were used to evaluate the importance of each feature. The number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens had the most significant impact on the predicted house prices. Binary features such as furnishings or French doors did not have a meaningful correlation with the price.
